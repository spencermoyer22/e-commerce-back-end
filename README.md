## Description
For this project, I worked on the back end side of a fake ecommerce site to use a database that contains categories, products, and tags for the products. I created relationships between the different items of the database to store data related to one another. I created api endpoints to get the data, add data, update it, or delete it based off the specifications in the routes. This will allow for user input once the back-end site would be tied to the front-end of a real e-commerce site. I created the routes using the expression npm package. I used dotenv to hide the program user's mysql login information.

## Installation
To install this program, clone the repository. Once you have the files open in your IDE, open a terminal and run the command `npm i`.
This will install the necessary npm packages, which in this case consits of MySQL2, Sequelize and dotenv. If you do you not have Node.js already downloaded, you 
must first download this. You should also create a .env file with the mysql variables used in the config/connection.js file to make sure your MySQL will connect to the database.

## Usage
After the program is successfully installed, follow [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-l0uuwwFDlJWa77SpJVVagMe037BD2K3/view) to watch a short video on how to run the program through your terminal.
